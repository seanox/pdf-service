# These mockup properties are used as optional preview.
# The properties creates a nested map structure for a data object, comparable to
# JSON. The nesting is based on the dot as separator in the key.
# The data structure supports three data types: Map, Collection, Text.
# Map and Collection are only used for nesting.
# Text can be a String or Markup if it contains HTML sequences <.../> or >...</.
# With the datatype Markup (CharSequence) there is no escape of HTML symbols.
# At the end a key with a String or Markup as value must always be used.
#
# The file is only needed for the test because PreviewTest finds the template
# via the annotation in the ClassPath.
# The file can be ignored.
