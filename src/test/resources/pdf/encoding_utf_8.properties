# Mock-up is part of the preview and design process to design and test the
# markup of the PDFs independently of the project. For this purpose, a property
# file with the same name can be provided parallel to the template file.
#
# The properties creates a nested map structure for a data object, comparable to
# JSON. The nesting is based on the dot as separator in the key.
# The data structure supports the data types: Collection, Map, Markup, Text.
# Collection and Map are only used for nesting.
# Text is markup if it contains HTML sequences <.../> or >...</.
# Markup indicates text where the escape of HTML symbols is not required.
# At the end a key with a text value is always expected.
#
#     Rules
#     ----
# - Properties are used for data and statics
#   Data uses all data as a structured map
#   Statics used only non-structured keys, without dot and list index
# - Key with dot is an indicator for structured data
#   Each dot in the key creates/uses a sub-map for the structured data map
# - Keys and partial keys ending with [n] create/use a list with a (sub-)map.
#       as an example:    
#   report.data[0].value = Value 1
#   report.data[1].value = Value 2
#   report.data[2].value = Value 3
#
#     Escape sequences of unicode
