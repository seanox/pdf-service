      Very special test and example for understanding the function of the
      generator and the preview data.
      
            Generator
            ----
      Structural placeholders are unique, comparable with templates and are
      overwritten during parsing.  
      The last definition wins.
      
      The depth or the nested structures are not important.
      The nesting is only a visual support for the developer.
            
            Preview Data
            ----
      Preview data as well as the data map primarily support a structured data
      structure, comparable to a tree structure.
      The branches/trees can be created by sub-maps and lists.
      But in the end it must be a key with a value corresponding to the
      placeholder.
      
      Therefore no value is shown in the example of:
          k.l[0].m.n[0].o.p[0] / k.l[0].m.n[0].o.p[1]
