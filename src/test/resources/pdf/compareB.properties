# These mockup properties are used as optional preview.
# The properties creates a nested map structure for a data object, comparable to
# JSON. The nesting is based on the dot as separator in the key.
# The map structure supports three data types: Map, Collection, Text.
# Map and Collection are only used for nesting.
# Text can be a String or Markup if it contains HTML sequences <.../> or >...</.
# With the datatype Markup (CharSequence) there is no escape of HTML symbols.
# At the end a key with a String or Markup as value must always be used.
#
# Rules: 
#   - the properties are used for data and statics
#     data use a structured map and statics use a flat map 
#   - each dot in the key creates/uses a sub-map for the structured data map
#   - if a (partial)key ends with [n], a list with a map is created/used
#     n is the index in the list
#         e.g. report.data[0].value = Value 1
#              report.data[1].value = Value 2
#              report.data[2].value = Value 3
